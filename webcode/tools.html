      <h2>What we have done</h2>
      <p>
      We have used our Microsoft Teams group and a collaborative 
      GitHub repository to organise our Project and assessment tasks. 
      We have created a GitHub pages website attached to our GitHub repository. 
      We have also used software applications; image editing software 
      (paint.net, Krita), video editing software (iMovie), Microsoft Office 365, 
      voice recording software, code editors (Unity, VS Code, Pico-8).
      </p>
      

      <h2>Comments on our activity logs</h2>
      <p>
        While most of our GitHub commits relate to our website, 
      we have also used the repository to store prototypes, 
      video files and general artifacts. The members who created 
      those artifacts are not necessarily the ones who committed 
      those files as some were uploaded to teams and moved across. 
      Our Teams group and our meeting artifacts give further context to 
      the work that individual team members have done.
      </p>
