        <h2>Danielle</h2>

        <p>We all worked well together again to complete tasks 3 and 5. We all got along, and everyone attended our regular team meetings. Since we had worked together in task 2 we all knew each others level of IT experience and assigned tasks accordingly. I have little IT experience so we decided I should make a paper prototype which was new to me, while they made more complicated prototypes. We started working on the assignments slightly late, however we managed our time well and completed the tasks. I was surprised that task 3 was very similar to task 2, I didn’t expect assignments to be so repetitive. I learnt that guys seem to be friendlier to work in a group with than all girls which I have done in the past.</p>

        <h2>Michael</h2>

        <p>Our team worked well together again. We already have knowledge of each other's strengths, so it allowed the team to allocate work easily. Because we worked to each member strengths the work was also completed surprisingly fast. This surprised me because I thought the prototypes might be out of scope for the timeframe, but they were completed well within the time.  </p>
        <p>Due to my work arrangements and COVID lockdowns happening in Melbourne my scheduling was erratic. The team again was accommodating to make sure I was still involved and kept up to date. This showed that as long as communication between group members is clear then problems can be worked around and not interrupt the work flow.</p>

        <h2>Jack</h2>
        <p>Our group was able to divide up our tasks well based on our strengths. We were able to improve upon the work we had done in assignment two and get some working prototypes for our project. I enjoyed learning more about Unity and Paint.net while working on the prototype.</p>
        <p>I think the only improvement we could have made is starting our meetings slightly earlier but given our groups diverse skill range we were able to complete the work efficiently by specializing. </p>
        <p>I was surprised at the similarities of this assignment to assignment 2 and at the quality of the work produced by my teammates. Particularly the website made by Tim. I was also a little surprised at how fare we were able to develop the prototypes.</p>
        <p>I’ve learnt the importance of roles when working in groups. Our team was able to output quality work far more efficiently in this assignment.</p>
 
        <h2>Timothy</h2>

        <p>Our team worked to our strengths in creating and carrying out tasks 
          three and five. We were able to use our shared knowledge to plan out 
          areas of focus for each individual team member. This allowed each of 
          us to try something new while sharing our own skills and knowledge 
          with the team. I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn a new 
          language (Lua) and to try out new software.
        </p>
        <p>While we didn’t immediately continue weekly team meetings, I think 
          this was for the best as we were able to take some time to decompress 
          and process our experiences with assessment task two. 
        </p>
        <p>I was surprised at how similar assessment task three was to assessment 
          task two. I hadn’t thoroughly read the brief for assessment task 
          three until we had submitted assessment task two. I guess I shouldn’t 
          have been surprised as assessment task two was very similar to 
          assessment task one, but I was expecting a little more variety in 
          assessment.
        </p>
        <p>As for one thing learned about groups, I work in a group every day, 
          so this experience hasn’t provided me with an opportunity to learn 
          further about groups and group work.
