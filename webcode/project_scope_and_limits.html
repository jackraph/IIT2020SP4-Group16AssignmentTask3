        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

        <p>As stated in our Aim section, our aim is to produce a publishable game. </p>
        <p>This means it is a game that is relatively bug free and contains the mechanics needed for the game to function. These are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A round begins with two player-controlled snakes.</li>
        <li>Each player can direct the snakes around the play area.</li>
        <li>Players can turn their snake left or right.</li>
        <li>The snakes move forward by themselves.</li>
        <li>Items appear on the play area.</li>
        <li>Each snake can collect items by placing its head on the item.</li>
        <li>When a snake collects an item, its body grows by one unit.</li>
        <li>When a snake collides with an obstacle, that player loses the round.</li>
        <li>A snake collides with an obstacle when it places its head on the obstacle. </li>
        <li>Snakes and walls are obstacles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are further features which would be in our ideal version of the game:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Two players can play the game over a network.</li>
        <li>Each player has a score.</li>
        <li>The score increases when items are collected.</li>
        <li>The players can select from different arena-levels before each round.</li>
        <li>The players can select a speed before each round which sets the speed the snakes move forward.</li>
        <li>The players can make their own levels within the game.</li>
        <li>Each player has a number of lives indicating the number of times their snake can die before they lose the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In terms of the platform that we are targeting, unity is a cross platform game engine that would allow us to port the game to multiple platforms in a matter of hours. Given the simple nature of the game this shouldnâ€™t create any platform dependant issues. </p>
        <p>The level creator will be prioritised as it will be designed to allow levels to be created quickly without any coding, allowing us to implement level content into the game in a relatively short period of time. This will allow designers without any coding knowledge to deploy levels.</p>
        <p>We decided to drop online multiplayer as an immediate feature. Although Unity has some primitive networking features the expansion and implementation of those features would take far too much time to be feasible.</p>
