        <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>

        <p>
          As the assessment specified, we were meeting at least twice per week via Teams. We did not start meetings immediately after finishing up task two. I feel it was a good to take a break as the amount of work was a bit overwhelming and the break gave the team time to reflect on our experiences of assessment task two (which was quite similar to assessment task three.) We took minutes and made recordings for all of our meetings. We communicate via Teams. All four group members were communicative. If a group member became uncommunicative, we would reach out to the subject coordinator to check on them. It would be out of character for anyone on this team to do that.
