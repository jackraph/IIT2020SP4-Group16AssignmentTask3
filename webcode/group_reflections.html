        <p>Our team worked to our strengths in creating and carrying out tasks 
          three and five. We were able to use our shared knowledge to plan out 
          areas of focus for each individual team member. This allowed each of 
          us to try something new while sharing our own skills and knowledge 
          with the team. I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn a new 
          language (Lua) and to try out new software.
        </p>
        <p>While we didn’t immediately continue weekly team meetings, I think 
          this was for the best as we were able to take some time to decompress 
          and process our experiences with assessment task two. 
        </p>
        <p>I was surprised at how similar assessment task three was to assessment 
          task two. I hadn’t thoroughly read the brief for assessment task 
          three until we had submitted assessment task two. I guess I shouldn’t 
          have been surprised as assessment task two was very similar to 
          assessment task one, but I was expecting a little more variety in 
          assessment.
        </p>
        <p>As for one thing learned about groups, I work in a group every day, 
          so this experience hasn’t provided me with an opportunity to learn 
          further about groups and group work.
